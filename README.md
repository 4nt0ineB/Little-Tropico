# Tropico
Very little game inspired by Tropico or Reigns in Java (in console first, with a GUI after)

This game is developed in an open source evolutionary logic. 
So, **you can add more events and scenarios to the game** in the subfolder *src > main > ressources*
in adding a folder with the name of your choice (where you will put your events) for the scenario. 
And then by adding it to the json in *src > main > ressources > init_scenarios.json*
