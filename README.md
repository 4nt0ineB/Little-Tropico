# Tropico
Very little game made with Java, inspired by Tropico or Reigns (in console first, with a GUI after).

This game is developed in an open source evolutionary logic. 
So, **you can add more events and scenarios to the game** in the subfolder *src > main > ressources > scenarios*
in adding a folder with the name of your choice (where you will put your events) for the scenario.
